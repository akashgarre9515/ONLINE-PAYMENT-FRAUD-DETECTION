Online Payment Fraud Detection Using XGBoost, DNN & WOA
This project implements a hybrid fraud detection system designed to identify fraudulent online payment transactions using advanced machine learning techniques. The workflow begins with data preprocessing—handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and balancing imbalanced classes.

The system uses a two-layer predictive pipeline:

XGBoost performs the initial classification and handles structured, tabular data.

Deep Neural Network (DNN) refines predictions by learning deeper, non-linear feature patterns.

Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) optimizes hyperparameters across both models to maximize performance.

A responsive frontend interface is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for real-time checking, transaction history tracking, and admin monitoring.
